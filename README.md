# **noflags-cli**

**The goal is just to minimize typing** (mostly because my keyboard is messed up).

Instead of using *flags/options*, just run the command with the input (or not even that), and then use a **CLI** to interact with the command line.

While this (at most) maybe *50% useful*, hopefully it makes the command line **less scary** and gives a fighting chance to **lazy people**.

## ***I'm pretty busy at the moment, this project will be worked on in the future***.
### *Sry 'bout that.*
